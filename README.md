# 3D Viewer

This project is a **3D Viewer** built with **React**, **Vite**, **Bootstrap**, and **Babylon.js**. It allows users to view and manipulate 3D models in STL and GLB formats. Users can apply rotations and positions to each imported file, enabling them to build models using different parts or simply view their 3D models.

## Features

- **View 3D Models:** Import and view STL and GLB files.
- **Manipulate Models:** Apply rotations and positions to customize the view of each part.
- **Model Building:** Combine multiple parts to build complex models.
